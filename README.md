These scenarios allow you to build event-driven systems using modern architectural patterns.

As you build your functions, you have the following options and resources available:

- **Use your preferred language**: Write functions in [C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python](./supported-languages.md), or use a [custom handler](./functions-custom-handlers.md) to use virtually any other language.

- **Automate deployment**: From a tools-based approach to using external pipelines, there's a [myriad of deployment options](./functions-deployment-technologies.md) available.

- **Troubleshoot a function**: Use [monitoring tools](./functions-monitoring.md) and [testing strategies](./functions-test-a-function.md) to gain insights into your apps.

- **Flexible pricing options**: With the [Consumption](./pricing.md) plan, you only pay while your functions are running, while the [Premium](./pricing.md) and [App Service](./pricing.md) plans offer features for specialized needs.
